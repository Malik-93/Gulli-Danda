    <p>Gullidanda is the brainchild of Manjot Singh. 
        After dropping out of college in his early 20s, Manjot worked for international organizations 
        in London in F&B, HR and interior design, before coming back to India again permanently.
        While leaving the UK, Manjot saw a contest where you could win an expensive luxury car 
        for a few pounds. Manjot entered the contest to win a Porsche 911--his dream car!
        Although he did not win, he loved the simple idea of a genuine, transparent,
        world-class way to win big for a small amount of money.</p>
     <p>This resulted in Manjot’s first skill gaming enterprise launched in 2013 called
          The Wishmasters.
          Although the business could not continue due to legalese,
          Manjot did not give up and is now back with Gullidanda.</p>

      <p>With years of experience and a will to succeed, Gullidanda is starting small, 
          but will soon expand its prize pool to over 5 million rupees per month! 
          Giveaways and lotteries are traditionally not considered to be genuine businesses
           due to the lack of transparency in the way the business functions. 
           Gullidanda aspires to change that by offering a transparent, world-class experience 
           that is unmatched in the industry. Aspiring to grow by enhanced
            customer trust and word of mouth, Gullidanda is the first skill
             gaming portal that puts great emphasis on
           transparency and trust--making them the building blocks of their organization.</p>

        <h2 class="how-does">How does this work ?</h2>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We’re glad you asked! As cricket is immensely popular in India, people who choose to
             enter a contest are shown a cricket scene where the ball is missing. 
             The player analyzes the image and uses his skills of judgement to determine where 
             the ball could be and marks the spot.
             Once the player has chosen the place where the ball should be, they can check out.</p>
        
        <p>On the completion of the contest, a panel of judges who are experienced cricket umpires
             collectively judge the same scene and give their professional opinion of where 
             they think the ball should be.
             The player whose mark is closest to the position chosen by the judges wins!</p>
            <br>
